## ![Info](http://u.swvn9.net/2017/q9Spz.png)

Watch is my first ever Discord bot, written with the JDA library. What better way to learn the Discord API than to give it a try.

Trust me, You don't want to use Watch. There are so many better options written by more experienced people. Watch is intended for my personal use, and is updated to fit my needs at the time. The latest stable release can be found in the releases tab if you do want to run this for some reason.

Watch currently splits to two shards, I realize this is not needed, it is just a remnant from testing with the feature.

## ![Install](http://u.swvn9.net/2017/fcoPV.png)

If for some reason you want to run this bot, it is pretty simple.
1. Download the Latest jar-with-dependencies. (Looks like `Watch-####-jar-with-dependencies.jar`)
1. Download the most up-to-date `example_config.yml`
1. Put the jar and config file in thier own folder, give them a home! (Something like `Watch/`)
1. Remove the `example_` from the config filename.
1. Fill the config file with any relevant information.
1. Run the bot, from the `Watch/` folder, run something along the lines of `java -jar Watch-####-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.*If you want to use a shell or bash script to run the bot, that part is up to you.*
1. You're ready to rock! You'll need to leave the command prompt window open, If you're running on some linux distro, I reccomend using screen to detach so you can safely disconnect from the session without killing the bot.

I am a programming student, and therefore am not fantastic at what I do. Don't set your expectations high if you do choose to run Watch.
